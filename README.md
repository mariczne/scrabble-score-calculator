## What is this?
It's a React web application that allows the user to calculate the Scrabble score of a word they choose, complete with all possible bonuses.

## Why was it made?
1. Because I found similar existing websites unsatisfactory - while some of them were almost perfect, they always had an area they were lacking in, i.e. usually they only had English letter scoring tables available
2. Because I needed a quick project to refresh my React skills
