# scrabble-score-calculator
## What is this?
It's a React web application that allows the user to calculate the Scrabble score of a word they choose, complete with all possible bonuses, with multiple languages' scoring tables available.

## How can I use it?
The app is live at <https://mariczne.github.io/scrabble-score-calculator/>

## Why was it made?
- Because similar apps usually have some kind of limitation, i.e. only a single language (English) letter scoring table is available
- Because I needed a quick project to refresh my React skills

## Features
- support for many language variants of Scrabble, including languages with di- or trigraph tiles (i.e. Spanish, Hungarian)
